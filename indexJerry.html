                	<p class="lead text-muted">Jerome Allen "Jerry" Seinfeld (born April 29, 1954)[9] is an American comedian, actor, writer, and producer. He is best known for portraying a semifictional version of himself in the sitcom Seinfeld (1989â€“1998), which he co-created and co-wrote with Larry David. For its final two seasons, they were also co-executive producers.

Seinfeld also co-wrote and co-produced the 2007 animated film Bee Movie, in which he voiced the protagonist. In 2010 he premiered a reality series called The Marriage Ref. He directed Colin Quinn in the Broadway show Long Story Short at the Helen Hayes Theater, which ran until January 2011. He is also the creator and host of the web series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.

In his stand-up comedy career, Seinfeld is known for specializing in observational humor, often focusing on personal relationships and uncomfortable social obligations. In 2005 Comedy Central named him the 12th-greatest stand-up comedian of all time

                    *Insert one of a million inside Seinfeld jokes here* But really it was such a good show with so many good moments. This was my dad's favorite show so it was on all the time growing up. When i was younger I used to despise it becuase I obviously didn't understand why it was so funny. Now that I'm older its become a nostalgic part of who I am. My family was so serious most of the time and being able to share something to laugh about with them was rare but meaningful. I think this show gave me my sense of humor and helped me learn to laugh off silly things in life.
